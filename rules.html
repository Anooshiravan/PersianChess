              <p><strong>Quick start:</strong> If you are proficient in chess and want a quick introduction to Persian
                Chess, visit the <a href="engine/index.html"
                  target="_blank" rel="noopener">Play!</a> page and select the “Celtic Citadel” sub-variant.</p>
              <hr />
              <p>To play Persian Chess, you must be familiar with standard chess. All FIDE rules, including castling, en
                passant, the fifty-move rule, check and checkmate, promotion, and under-promotion, apply here. If you
                are unfamiliar with FIDE chess rules, refer to this page for detailed explanations. Without
                understanding these basics, you cannot play Persian Chess, as it builds upon standard chess
                fundamentals.</p>
              <blockquote>
                <p>The special rules of Persian Chess are split into two sections: basic rules and sub-variant rules.
                  Basic rules apply to all sub-variants, while there are currently four sub-variants defined:<br />
                  <strong>1- Celtic Citadel</strong><br />
                  <strong>2- Persian Princess</strong><br />
                  <strong>3- Egyptian Eye</strong><br />
                  <strong>4- Experimental sub-variant: Oriental Omega</strong>
                </p>
              </blockquote>
              <p><img class="alignleft" src="site/img/persian-princess-logo.jpg" alt="Persian Chess: Persian Princess"
                  width="253" height="142" /></p>
              <p>The sub-variants <strong>Persian Princess</strong>, <strong>Egyptian Eye</strong>, and <strong>Oriental
                  Omega</strong> have their own specific rules. However, <strong>Celtic Citadel</strong> is played using
                only the basic rules, making it the core sub-variant and ideal for beginners.</p>
              <p><strong>Egyptian Eye</strong> introduces a unique, neutral piece that attacks both players
                simultaneously, making it the most complex sub-variant.</p>

              <h2>Basic Rules (Applicable to All Sub-variants)</h2>
              <p>Two compound (fairy) pieces are added to the game:</p>

              <h3>Princess</h3>
              <p>(White Princess at g2, Black Princess at g10) — Moves like both a Bishop and a Knight.<br />
                Princess movement is shown below:</p>
              <p><img class="aligncenter" src="site/img/princess-movement.jpg" alt="Princess movement" width="408"
                  height="407" /></p>

              <h3>Fortress</h3>
              <p>(White Fortress at a1, k1; Black Fortress at a11, k11) — Moves like both a Rook and a Knight.<br />
                Fortress movement is shown below:</p>
              <p><img class="aligncenter" src="site/img/fortress-movement.jpg" alt="Fortress movement" width="408"
                  height="407" /></p>

              <h3>Castling Rules</h3>
              <p>Standard FIDE castling rules apply. If the king has moved, is in check, or the castling squares are
                attacked, castling is not allowed.</p>

              <h4>Princess-side Castling (Long Castle: King moves 3 squares)</h4>
              <p>White: King to i2 → Rook to h2<br />
                Black: King to i10 → Rook to h10</p>
              <p><img class="aligncenter" src="site/img/princessside-castle.jpg" alt="Long castling" width="406"
                  height="406" /></p>

              <h4>Queen-side Castling (Short Castle: King moves 2 squares)</h4>
              <p>White: King to d2 → Rook to e2<br />
                Black: King to d10 → Rook to e10</p>
              <p><img class="aligncenter" src="site/img/queenside-castle.jpg" alt="Short castling" width="407"
                  height="408" /></p>

              <h3>Citadel Draw Rule</h3>
              <p>If a king moves to an opponent's Citadel square (a11, k11 for White; a1, k1 for Black), the game ends
                in a draw, regardless of material or position. This historical rule has been preserved in Persian Chess.
              </p>

              <h2>Sub-variant Rules for Celtic Citadel</h2>
              <p><img class="aligncenter" src="site/img/celtic-citadel-logo.jpg" alt="Celtic Citadel" width="500"
                  height="280" /></p>
              <p><strong>Celtic Citadel</strong> uses only the basic rules and is the simplest sub-variant. Its starting
                position is shown below:</p>
              <p><img class="aligncenter" src="site/img/celtic-citadel-start.jpg" alt="Celtic Citadel start position"
                  width="505" height="505" /></p>

              <h2>Sub-variant Rules for Persian Princess</h2>
              <p><img class="aligncenter" src="site/img/persian-princess-logo.jpg" alt="Persian Princess" width="500"
                  height="280" /></p>
              <p>The starting position differs from Celtic Citadel. It features two dark-squared bishops, which can
                change through the “Rendezvous” rule:</p>
              <p><img class="aligncenter" src="site/img/persian-princess-start.jpg"
                  alt="Persian Princess start position" width="505" height="505" /></p>

              <h4>Rendezvous</h4>
              <p>If the Princess moves from its home square (g2/g10) to h2/h10, and a friendly bishop occupies that
                square, they switch places. This transforms a dark-squared bishop into a light-squared bishop. This
                maneuver can be performed once per game by each player.</p>
              <p><img class="aligncenter" src="site/img/rendezvous.jpg" alt="Rendezvous" width="505" height="505" /></p>

              <h2>Sub-variant Rules for Egyptian Eye</h2>
              <p><img class="aligncenter" src="site/img/egyptian-eye-logo.jpg" alt="Egyptian Eye" width="500"
                  height="280" /></p>
              <p>The start position is similar to Persian Princess, with the addition of ASE (All Seeing Eye) at the
                center (f6). ASE attacks both players simultaneously along the diagonals but does not move.</p>
              <p><img class="aligncenter" src="site/img/ase-start.jpg" alt="Egyptian Eye start position" width="506"
                  height="503" /></p>

              <h2>Experimental Sub-variant: Oriental Omega</h2>
              <p><img class="aligncenter" src="site/img/oriental-omega-logo.jpg" alt="Omega chess 9x9" width="500"
                  height="280" /></p>
              <p>This sub-variant adds two new pieces inspired by Omega Chess: Champion and Wizard. The starting
                position is shown below:</p>
              <p><img class="aligncenter" src="site/img/oriental-omega-start.jpg" alt="Oriental Omega start position"
                  width="500" height="501" /></p>

              <h3>Champion</h3>
              <p>(White Champion at g2, Black Champion at g10) — Movement is shown below:</p>
              <p><img class="aligncenter" src="site/img/champion-movement.jpg" alt="Champion movement" width="374"
                  height="374" /></p>

              <h3>Wizard</h3>
              <p>(White Wizards at a1, k1; Black Wizards at a11, k11) — Movement differs slightly from Omega Chess and
                is depicted below:</p>
              <p><img class="aligncenter" src="site/img/wizard-movement.jpg" alt="Wizard movement" width="383"
                  height="383" /></p>

              <h3>Rendezvous</h3>
              <p>The Rendezvous rule from Persian Princess also applies here: Champions may switch places with bishops,
                changing their color square.</p>
