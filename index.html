              <p>Persian Chess is an evolved version of the traditional chess game, introducing a new design and fresh
                gameplay while staying connected to its historical roots. This variant changes the standard setup,
                offering players a different yet familiar experience that enriches the strategic possibilities of chess.
              </p>
              <p>
                This variant of chess has been in development since 2006, involving years of research, design, and
                programming. The current engine is built in JavaScript, making it easily playable in web browsers and on
                mobile apps using Apache Cordova. The game and its Android app are Free and Open Source, inviting
                players and developers to enjoy and contribute.</p>

              <p>Persian Chess was first playable in June 2006 on a 9×9 "citadel" board, though the early version was
                basic and buggy. After extensive rule refinement and several updates, the game saw its first stable
                release in 2013 under the name "Chess911." Feedback led to a rebranding, and by 2014 it was renamed to
                Persian Chess, better reflecting the theme and origins of the game.</p>

                  alt="Persian Chess variant: Persian Princess" width="500" height="280" /></p>

              <p>The game features several sub-variants, each with its own unique theme:</p>

              <p><b>Celtic Citadel</b><br />
                <b>Princess</b><br />
                <b>Egyptian Eye</b><br />
                <b>Oriental Omega</b>
              </p>

                  alt="Persian Chess variant: Celtic Citadel" width="500" height="280" /></p>

              <p>Persian Chess is distinct from the "Mad Queen" (MQ) family of chess, such as the standard 8×8 FIDE
                chess, where the queen is the dominant piece. Instead, Persian Chess introduces additional compound
                pieces, the **Princess** and the **Fortress**, which provide new tactical possibilities and enrich the
                gameplay. These pieces are integral to the game, not treated as "fairy pieces," but as natural
                extensions of traditional chess mechanics.</p>

              <p>The game uses a 9×9 "perfect" board, designed to offer symmetrical start positions with the king in the
                central file. This layout eliminates the standard king-side and queen-side labels, instead using **Queen
                side** (left of the king) and **Princess side** (right of the king). The expanded board size leads to
                longer and more complex games, requiring careful planning and calculation in all phases of the game.</p>

              <p><h3>Why Play Persian Chess?</h3><br />
                The goal of Persian Chess is to provide a fresh approach to chess while challenging players to go beyond
                rote memorization of standard openings. The unique pieces and expanded board offer new strategic
                options, making each game a test of creativity and skill. For players interested in deep positional play
                and complex calculations, Persian Chess offers an engaging experience that can help develop skills
                useful in standard 8×8 chess.</p>

              <p>Whether you are a chess enthusiast or someone looking for a new challenge, Persian Chess offers a
                different perspective on the game, with longer opening lines, dynamic middle game play, and intricate
                endgames.</p>
